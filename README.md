# Banking Application
 - I have done this project in my 2nd semester of B.Tech using java.It simulates a virtual banking experience.

## Some of the features of the App:
      > Generates random unique account number for each user
      > Performs client side validations with proper checks
      > Allows to check last five transactions
      > Allows login functionality for accessing account
      > Stores all the data into binary file before program is terminated

# Future work
  - Adding Graphical User Interface by replacing command line interface
  - Storing data into a database instead of files

# Requirements
  - Java 1.8
